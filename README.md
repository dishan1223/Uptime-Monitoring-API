# Uptime Monitoring API

Uptime Monitoring API is a free API that allows you to check the uptime or downtime of any user-defined website.

## Insights

This API is written purely in **Node.js**. Currently, it uses the local file system for storage, but a proper database will be added soon. 

- **Staging Server:** Runs on `localhost:3000`
- **Production Server:** Runs on `localhost:5000`

More features will be added to both the production and staging servers soon.
